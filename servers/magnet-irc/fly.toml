# ABOUTME: Fly.io configuration for magnet-irc (anycast leaf IRC servers)
# ABOUTME: Client-facing servers with dynamic identity from FLY_REGION
#
# IMPORTANT: This app requires a DEDICATED IPv4 address for TCP services to work.
# Fly.io shared IPs only work for HTTP/HTTPS on ports 80/443.
# Allocate with: flyctl ips allocate-v4 -a magnet-irc --yes
#
# The proxy_proto handlers enable PROXY protocol for client IP preservation.
# go-mmproxy running in the container unwraps these headers and spoofs the
# original client IP when forwarding to Solanum.
